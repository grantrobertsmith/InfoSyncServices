# InfoSyncServices

##Big Picture

The aim of this project is to automate human location awareness based on an individual's desire of the extent to which one determines one's location should be known by others. When in doubt, the information should be hidden and the individual should be prompted to provide access to that information.

###Puzzle Pieces
0. Automated Address Syncing
1. Personal(izable?) Information Distriution Contols
2. Trust Standards
3. Location Awareness
4. Minimized, Intelligent Human-Pinging

##Current Work

As a basic piece of the project, allow individuals to setup a source location (effectively a website or device) and allow them to specify destination locations to which the source information should be synced automatically whenever the source is updated (or according to any user preferences). This roughly corresponds to piece 0 above.

Initially, piece 0 will be built as a proof of concept to sync google+ and facebook information as those services are both already free and open and likely provide suitable api for automation of the process. Concurrently, alternative platforms should be investigeted and added.
